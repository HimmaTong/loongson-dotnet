 Loongson .NET Core Home
===========================

The [gsvm/loongson-dotnet](https://github.com/gsvm/loongson-dotnet) repository is a good starting point for Loongson's port of .NET Core.

We hope to implement a release version (3.0 or 3.1) of Loongson/MIPS Port first, then upgrade to upstream [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) .

This repository may be temporary, but may exist for a long time. Our hope is to merge into upstream.


## Current Status

We are debugging priority1 test cases in CoreCLR. More than 9500 tests have been passed according to our test method.


## How to Use MIPS Port of .NET Core

It has not yet reached the state of use. We will release Early-Access Builds of .NET Core runtime later.


## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

We encourage contributions, both issues and PRs. All contributions and suggestions are greatly welcomed. If you have any problems or want any support, feel free to file a issue or contact us via email to aoqi@loongson.cn.
